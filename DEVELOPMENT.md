## Running Tests

### Unit tests
This type of testing is fast and should be the first thing you do before committing your code.  Mistakes can be found
in a matter of seconds vs minutes/hours.  You can test your logic in a unit test.  The downside is you need to learn
how to write unit tests which can take some initial time getting used to.

```shell
bundle exec rake spec
```
